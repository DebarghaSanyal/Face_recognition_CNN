# Face Recognition Model

## 📌 Overview

This project implements a face recognition model using machine learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). It aims to accurately identify and verify individuals based on facial features.

## ✨ Features

- 🔍 Face detection and recognition
- 🤖 Model trained using machine learning techniques
- 📈 High accuracy and efficiency

## 📂 Dataset Details

The dataset used for training and evaluation was obtained from:
**2nd IEEE Workshop on Applications of Computer Vision  December 1994, Sarasota (Florida)**

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- 🐍 Python
- 👀 OpenCV
- 📊 Scikit-learn
- 🔢 NumPy
- 📑 Pandas

## 🚀 Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DebarghaSanyal/Face_recognition_CNN.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Face_recognition_CNN
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install python opencv-python scikit-learn numpy pandas
   ```

## 🎯 Usage

1. Run the model:
   ```bash
   python Face_recognition_CNN.py
   ```
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to input images and test the recognition system.

## 📊 Results

- The model achieves high accuracy of 90%-98% in recognizing faces from the dataset.
- Efficient performance on real-time data.
